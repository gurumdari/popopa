# PoPoPa
PoPoPa is a software that manages the schedule of collaborative projects. Gantt charts are available for viewing at a glance, and you can add and edit tasks directly in the gantt charts you see. It provides risk management function by adding memo or issue to each schedule task. Gantt charts can be converted into weekly reports or monthly reports in real time, and it also provides weekly or monthly reports that can be converted into reports including the entire team.

> PoPoPa was developed with the aim of improving the unreasonable situation of the weekly report for Friday to be reported on Monday, so that it can be used more realistically. For example, if you have an executive report on a Friday for a one-week work report, there will be a departmental report on Thursday, a project-specific report on Wednesday, a team member report on Tuesday, Ultimately, personal reporting needs to happen on Monday. Since the final report for Friday should be written on Monday, the perforemed report on Monday should be written in the form of a job that you have not done yet. And the scheduled report should be written in the form of a job that will take place after two weeks.

> The problem is that if you write down what you need to do in the future, it is reported that there is no issue in the final Friday reporting, but in reality, issues can arise. There is no issue on the final Friday report, and it is reported that it is in progress. Misrepresentations can go too far in order to correct them again, which can lead to situations where the workload is overloaded and can not be reversed.

> In a nutshell, PoPoPa improves the problem of forecasted reports by switching to real-time weekly or monthly reports.
